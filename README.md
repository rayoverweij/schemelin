# Schemelin

A basic Scheme interpreter, all in one Kotlin file. Written as a school assignment, but open to anyone who's interested. Inspired by Peter Norvig's Lispy.

Includes support for:
* Mathematical operations
* Defining variables and procedures
* `lambda` and `let`
* Basic list operations
* Very basic string operations

For deeper insights, check out the code! There are plenty of comments.
